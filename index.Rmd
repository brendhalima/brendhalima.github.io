# **Hello, I'm Brendha!**

Data Engineer with a Bachelor’s degree in Statistics from the Federal University of Paraná [(UFPR)](http://www.ufpr.br/portalufpr/) and an MBA in Data Science and Analytics from [USP/ESALQ](https://mbauspesalq.com/sobre). I have hands-on experience in developing interactive dashboards and automation workflows using R and Shiny, enhancing efficiency in data analysis. Additionally, I implement unit testing to ensure the reliability of data solutions and manage data processing and storage on AWS S3, optimizing data workflows for scalability and performance.

Proficient in Python, I leverage its ecosystem to develop ETL pipelines, automate data workflows, and perform advanced data analysis. My expertise includes working with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy and PySpark.

My approach blends statistical rigor with a strategic mindset, allowing me to transform complex datasets into actionable insights. I am passionate about building scalable, efficient, and data-driven solutions that empower decision-making.

Currently, I work at Argus Media, specializing in dashboard development, automation, visualization and data processing for price generation and commodity benchmarks.
